== Welcome to WeatheredWatcher and Blogsxom

Yeah, yeah.  I know it's a blatant rip-off of Blosxom, but what can I say....Imitation is the Sincerest Form of Flattery.  Basically, this is my site.  The important part of it, though, is a little bit of controller code under def blog.  It is here that I am working on my very own file-system based blog.  It's simple.  That's what I like.  If you wish to integrate this system into your own site or blog, it is very easy to do.  You are more than welcome to download my site from git-hub to use as an example, but I all you really need to do is take a look at my gist # 412912.  Here I list all the code that you need to get things started.
