<h1>The Greatest Guitarist..Ever</h1> 
<p>Ironically, the second post in my new blog, which is generally very technologically oriented, has nothing to do with computers or programming at all!
See, I have a Jimmi Hendrix t-shirt.  I like to wear it, and when I do I always get comments on it.  I wore this other day, and it got a conversation struck up
with one of my neighbors.  I made the usual comment that I felt Hendrix wasn't the greatest guitarist of his time, but had he lived, he would now be the greatest
guitarist.  He initially didn't agree with me.  And while he still might not, he got what I was saying: Hendrix was great, but he never got to reach his ultimate
potential.  But it did get me thinking.  As a guitarist, who did I think the greatest guitarts were?  My short list would include Hendrix, Clapton, Beck, 
Townsend, Richards and Page.  I notice that this is a decidedly older crowd that I have.  It's not any kind of bias: I was born in 1981, one year after the break 
up of Led Zeppelin.  That's 11 year after the death of Hendrix.  So why?  What about Slash?  The Edge?  Countless other guitarist who, quite frankly are damn good.
I started thinking about it, and it came to me.  These were to pioneers.  Everone who has ever come after, has only followed in the footsteps of these men.  What they 
did was unique in their day.  When Pete Townsend broke the first guitar on stage, people had their minds blown.  When Richards first stood up on stage with Jagger and played
that three note guitar riff that starts and drive Satisfaction, people's minds were blown.
