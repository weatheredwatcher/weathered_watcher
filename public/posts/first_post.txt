<h1>First Post</h1> 
<p>This is my first post in my new blog. Several years ago, before I started using WordPress, I was using a simple perl script called <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a>
It's great system that served me well. However, I started coding sites in WordPress and decided to switch my blog over to the WordPress system.  And I must say
that I was very happy with WordPress.  However, I am not a fan of all the overhead that is involved in WordPress.  For example, why should I have to login and use some
WYSIWYG editor to code my blog entries?  There is just a lot of things that have to happen, just to get the words that I type online for other people to read.
</p>
<p> Recently, I have been re-evaluating my online life (as well as the costs that come with it).  My move from a PHP developer to a Ruby on Rails Developer has also played a part.
I yearned for the simplisity of Blosxom.  I also like that I can host a blog for free at Heroku.  My needs are not much.  So, I set about looking for a replacments for my WordPress that would 
work like Blosxom and yet run on Rails.  And I found a lot of code from a lot of like-minded folks. However, I did have some caveats that were not being met.</p>

<h3>Has to integrate with my site...in rails</h3>
<p> This is my first requirement.  I have a website that is not just a blog, and I need the blog to function as a blog, within the framework of the rest of my site.
All the code that I found seem to mirror the idea behind Blosxom, but they just function as blogs.  I need this to work on one page only.  The rest is just pages.
</p>
<h3>It needs to be expandable</h3>
<p>One of the neat things about Blosxom is it's plugins.  You can add as many or as few as you want.  So, my engine needs to be flexible</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, here is my answer to this issue.  It is a simple bit of ruby code that scans a directory for files and then renders them on the page.  I choose to use
html to mark-up my posts before hand, rather than use some other mark-up language.  This might change over time.<p>
<p>Also, I am currently not supporting tags or indiviual post pages, although this too is something that I plan on implementing.</p>
